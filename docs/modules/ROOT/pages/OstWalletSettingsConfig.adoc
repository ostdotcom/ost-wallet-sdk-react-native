= OstWallet Settings Config

== Introduction

App developers can configure the text shown on settings page.

To configure the content, the sdk needs to be provided with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON[JSON object].

The default configuration can be found link:../js/WalletSettings/ost-wallet-settings-config.json[here].

== Dictionary Data Structure

Here is the small sample json representation of the configuration.

{
  "item_display_order": [
	"activate_user",
  ],
  "item_configs": {
	"activate_user": {
	  "content_config": {
        "heading": "Activate User",
        "description": "User is not activated yet."
      },
      "config": {
        "spending_limit": "0",
        "expiration_time": 0
      }
	}
  }
}
