After updating the SDK, please delete `ostwalletrnSDK` using the *Remove References* option and add it back by following link:../iOSSetup.adoc#5-add-additional-SDK-files[this step].

== Usage

* Initialize the SDK
* Subscribe to events
* Implement `OstWalletWorkFlowCallback` for a workflow
* Execute workflow

=== Initialize the SDK

You must initialize the SDK before using it.

[NOTE]
Initialize the SDK in using BASE_URL (Ost Platform endpoint) inside App.js `constructor()` method.

[source,javascript]
----
/**
   * Initialize wallet SDK
   * @param {String} endpoint - Ost Platform endpoint
   * @param {function} Callback function with error and success status.
   * @public
   */
  OstWalletSDK.initialize( endpoint,
            (error, success) => {})
----

[source,javascript]
----
include::initialize.js
----


=== Initializing SDK With Config

Starting version `2.3.1` application can also pass SDK config in the initialize method

[NOTE]
If config is passed in `initialize` method, the configs specified in `OstWalletSDK.plist` and `ost-mobileSDK.json` are ignored.
It is no longer mandatory to define `ost-mobileSDK.json` and `OstWalletSDK.plist` files.

[source,javascript]
----
  let SDKConfig = {
    "BLOCK_GENERATION_TIME": 3,
    "PIN_MAX_RETRY_COUNT": 3,
    "REQUEST_TIMEOUT_DURATION": 60,
    "SESSION_BUFFER_TIME": 3600,
    "PRICE_POINT_CURRENCY_SYMBOL": "USD",
    "USE_SEED_PASSWORD": false,
    "NO_OF_SESSIONS_ON_ACTIVATE_USER": 1,
    "ENABLE_IOS_DEVICE_RESTORE": false
  };

  /**
  * Initialize wallet SDK
  * @param {String} endpoint - Ost Platform endpoint
  * @param {Object} config (optional) - SDK Config. Supported from version 2.3.1
  * @param {function} callback -   A typical node-style, error-first callback.
  * @callback params {Object}error , {Boolean} success
  * @public
  */
  OstWalletSDK.initialize( endpoint, SDKConfig, (error, success) => {

  });
----

=== Subscribe to `OstWalletSDKEvents` in your top most level component

In the most top level component [mostly `App.js`] import like this:

[source,javascript]
----
import { OstWalletSDKEvents, OstWalletSDK, OstWalletSDKUI, OstJsonAPI } from '@ostdotcom/ost-wallet-SDK-react-native';
----

In `componentDidMount()` subscribe to OstWalletSDKEvents and in `componentWillUnmount()` unsubscribe to OstWalletSDKEvents. Also initialize the SDK in using BASE_URL (Ost Platform endpoint) `constructor()` method:

[source,javascript]
----
class App extends Component {

  constructor() {
    super();
    OstWalletSDK.initialize(BASE_URL, (error, success) => {
      if(error) {
        console.warn(error);
      }
      else {
        console.warn(success);
      }

    });
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    OstWalletSDKEvents.subscribeEvent();
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    OstWalletSDKEvents.unsubscribeEvent();
  }

}
----

== Getter Methods

The SDK provides getter methods that applications can use for various purposes. These methods provide the application with data as available in the device's database.

Please refer to xref:OstWalletSDKGetMethods.adoc[Ost Wallet SDK Getter Methods] for documentation.

== Ost JSON APIs

While the getter methods provide application with data stored in device's database, the JSON API methods make API calls to Ost Platform servers.

Please refer to xref:OstJsonAPI.adoc[Ost JSON API] for documentation.

== Quick Start Guide

Starting version 2.3.12-beta.1, developers can enable all the Ost wallet features implementing the *Ost Macro Workflows.*

=== 1. Setup Device Core Workflow

The setup device workflow establishes trust between the device and Ost Platform. As application is responsible for user authentication, application servers must facilitate this workflow using the server side SDK.

==== Workflow Details

* When this workflow is initiated by the application, the SDK creates the following keys:
 ** API key - the key used to sign API requests sent to Ost Platform from the SDK
 ** Device key - the user's wallet device key. All device manager operations shall be performed using this key.
* The SDK asks the application to register the device entity with Ost Platform
* The application must send the device entity to the application server
* The application server must then use the server side SDK to register the device with Ost Plaform by using device service's create device API.
* Once the device is registered by the Ost Platform, the application server must send the response to the mobile application.
* The mobile application must then use the `deviceRegistered` callbacks to provide the response to the SDK.
* The SDK validates the registration by making API calls to the Ost Plaform.

image::setup_device_workflow.svg[setup device workflow]

[NOTE]
====
* Setup device workflow must be initiated *on every app launch*.
* Setup device workflow must be initiated only *after the user has been autheniticated* by the application, including cookie based authentication for already logged-in users.
* Each of user's device creates its own API key and device key.
* User's Device and API keys are not shared across devices.
* User's API key & device key are stored in persistent storage on the device and created only if needed.
* The SDK shall request for device registration only when needed.
`registerDevice` shall not be invoked if device is already authorized and SDK is able to make API calls to Ost Platform.
====

==== Implementation

Please refer to xref:OstCoreWorkflows.adoc#setupdevice[`setupDevice` core workflow documentation] for implementation details.

=== 2. Activate User UI Workflow

Activate User workflow deploys user's wallet on the blockchain and whitelists the user's wallet and enables it to take part in application's brand token economy.

==== Blockchain Transactions Performed During Activate User Workflow

* Deploys user's contracts
 ** Device-manager and token-holder contracts
 ** Set user's recovery key address, device key address in device-manager contract
 ** Authorizes session key(s) in token-holder contract
* Whitelists user's contract in UBT (Utility Brand Token Contract).

==== Recovery Key Generation Using 6 Digit Pin

* User's recovery key is generated using https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Scrypt[SCrypt], a password-based key derivation function.
* The '`password`' provided to this function is a string created by concatenating:
* A prefix provided by application server.

Application server must generate and store prefix for each user, treat it as sensitive and immutable information.

* User's PIN
* User's Ost-id
* The salt required for SCrypt is provided by Ost Platform

==== Implementation

Please refer to xref:OstWalletUI.adoc#activate-user[Activate User UI Workflow Documentation] for implementation details.

=== 3. Wallet Settings UI Component

OstWallet Settings is a pre-built UI component available exclusively available in `ost-wallet-SDK-react-native` SDK. It is a wallet settings page that can be used by end-users to perfrom 12 different wallet operations and view their wallet details.

[WARNING]
This feature requires application to use https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html[React Navigation] package.

==== Implementation

Please refer to xref:OstWalletSettings.adoc[OstWallet Settings Documentation] for implementation details.

=== 4. Redemption Flow UI Component

OstRedemption component is a pre-built UI component available exclusively in `ost-wallet-SDK-react-native` SDK. It consist two pages - one displaying redeemable product list and another displaying product details and redemption options. It can be used by end-users to integrate redemption flow into their app.

[WARNING]
This feature requires application to use https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html[React Navigation] package.

==== Implementation

Please reder to xref:OstRedemptionFlow.adoc[OstRedemption flow Documentation] for implementation details.

=== 5. OstTransaction Helper - Transaction and Add Session Integrated Workflow

`OstTransactionHelper` is a transaction helper provided by the SDK that creates session keys before performing a transaction if needed. App developers can configure the session creation parameters (session buckets) as per application's need.

==== Implementation

Please refer to xref:OstTransactionHelper.adoc[Ost Transaction Helper Documentation] for implementation details.

== Intermediate Usage - Ost Wallet SDK UI

For quick and easy integration with SDK, developers can use built-in user-interface components which are configurable and support content and theme customization.

Please refer to xref:OstWalletUI.adoc[Ost Wallet SDK UI] for documentation.

== Advance Usage - Ost Wallet Core Workflow APIs

Ost core workflows API do not use any UI components, thereby giving complete ux control to the developers. The xref:OstWalletUI.adoc[`OstWalletSDKUI`] also uses Ost core workflows.

Please refer to xref:./documentation/OstCoreWorkflows.adoc[Ost Core Workflow APIs] for documentation.

== Known Issues <!>

=== SDK Initialization Fails on Android 9 (API level 28)

Starting with Android 9 (API level 28), https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config#CleartextTrafficPermitted[cleartext support] is disabled by default.

On the other hand, Ost Wallet Android SDK leverages on *Public Key Pinning* to ensure the authenticity of a Ost Platform server's public key used in TLS sessions using https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit-Android[TrustKit].

As TrustKit can only be inititialized with application's https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config[network security configuration], SDK initialization fails.

To work-around this issues, application needs to have TrustKit as a dependency and initialize it.

=== Setup Device Workflow Fails on iOS-13 Simulator

Ost Wallet SDK uses iOS's https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/certificate_key_and_trust_services/keys/storing_keys_in_the_keychain[Keychain] to store user's cryptographic keys.
Unfortunately, Keychain doesn't work as expected on iOS-13 Simulators.
We request you to kindly test your application on actual iOS-13 device while we continue to look for a workaround.
